Welcome to Part 1 of the project for ECSE429!

This project repository tests todos, categories and project endpoints as we are a team of 3. However, we also added some extra interoperability tests for todos and projcets.

You can download the project by pressing the play button for all the tests in your IDE of choice or you can also run it through the command line using `./gradlew test` in the `test_gradle` directory of the repository. Before running the tests for all commands, make sure that you do not have any http://localhost:4567 running as it might affect the tests.

\*Note that the gradle project is in the test_gradle directory
