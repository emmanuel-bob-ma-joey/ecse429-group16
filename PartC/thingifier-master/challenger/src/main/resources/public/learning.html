# Learning

## Mirror Mode

The Mirror mode is a good way to test out your tooling and see the details of your requests without using a proxy.

[Access the Mirror Mode Here](/mirror.html)

## Simulation Mode

The API has a simulation mode, it uses hard coded data in responses, but tries to mimic some conditions.

e.g. it expects you to post a specific JSON payload or XML payload and responds 'as if' you sent it. But... it also checks if you sent valid json, or valid xml, and responds based on your headers e.g. returning XML if you ask for it.

The simulator is stateless and does not track your usage, making it deterministic for multiple users.

The simulator is a good place to get started because it will respond nicely... unless you mess up the request syntax.

Buying the book helps support this web site and application.

## Challenge Tutorials

All of the Challenges have solution tutorials that are available on the [EvilTester.com](https://eviltester.com) blog.
