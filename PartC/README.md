Welcome to Part 3 of the project for ECSE429!

This project repository performs performance tests on the to do Rest API provided on mycourses.

You can download the project and run the test through the command `./gradlew test` in the `PartC` directory. Transaction time, memory usage and cpu usage graphs would be generated and placed in the graphs directory.

Before running the tests for all commands, make sure that you do not have any http://localhost:4567 running as it might affect the tests.
